# Real Time NodeJS

This is a learning exercise from Lynda.com with Kyle Simpson on working with real time node web applications.

* Created 1.js file working with most basic code such as console.log("Hello World")
* Installed minimist module via npm install and required the module in order to
  output World as the argument
* Added hand coded hello module calling synchronous and asychronous functions
  and error handling
* Modified the helloworld2.js with abstraction code in order to, more
  efficiently, generate the contents of a file, such as using the asyquence module, for callback and error handling using built in function
* Added socket.io and node-static devDependencies
* Modified helloworld3.js file module to generate data streams
* Added 4.server.js file to create a web server with http request and response,
  port listening, and conditionals for GET and url to output simple text
* Added 5.server.js file demonstrating how to require asynquence module to
  generate a text file
* Added 6.server.js file demonstrating how to serve up static web pages
* Added 7.server.js and 8.server.js demonstrating web socket io handling and
  serving html page with console logging to verify client connections
* Added 9.server.js and 9.html demonstrating web socket io to other
  users with socket emit and broadcasting to achieve realtime messaging
  across multiple open instances of the same page anywhere
* Added 10.server.js and 10.html demonstrating how web sockets can track
  mouse movements
* Added 11.server.js and 11.html demonstrating how web rtc works
