# Real Time NodeJS

This is a learning exercise from Lynda.com with Kyle Simpson on working with real time node web applications.

* Created 1.js file working with most basic code such as console.log("Hello World")
* Installed minimist module via npm install and required the module in order to
  output World as the argument
* Added hand coded hello module calling synchronous and asychronous functions
  and error handling
* Modified the helloworld2.js with abstraction code in order to, more
  efficiently, generate the contents of a file, such as using the asyquence module, for callback and error handling using built in function
